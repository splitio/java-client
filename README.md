## Compatibility

## Getting started
Below is a simple example that describes the instantiation and most basic usage of our SDK:

```java
import io.split.client.SplitFactoryBuilder;
import io.split.client.SplitClient;

public  class App {

    public static void main() {
        SplitClientConfig config = SplitClientConfig.builder()
                .setBlockUntilReadyTimeout(10000)
                .build();
        SplitFactory splitFactory = SplitFactoryBuilder.build("YOUR_SDK_KEY", config);
        SplitClient client = splitFactory.client();
        try {
            client.blockUntilReady();
        } catch (TimeoutException | InterruptedException e) {
            // log & handle
        }

        String treatment = client.getTreatment("CUSTOMER_ID", "FEATURE_FLAG_NAME");
        if (treatment.equals("on")) {
            // Feature flag is enabled for this user!
        } else if (treatment.equals("off")) {
            // Feature flag is disabled for this user!
        } else {
            // Unable to perform evaluation.
        }
    }
}
```
